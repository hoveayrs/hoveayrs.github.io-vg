		      “...educated, specific, non-invasive touch that supports the body’s innate ability to heal”
		      Robyn Scherr CST
		    </h3>
		    <p>
		      Craniosacral Therapy provides a rare space where an individual’s whole physiological system is
		      listened to by the trained practitioner. The therapist pays attention to subtle movements in
		      the body that maintain health, and uncovers tensions that can interfere with the potent flow
		      of life in the body. These areas of restriction often manifest in symptoms such as digestive
		      problems, sinus issues, headaches, hormonal imbalances and back pain. Many of these symptoms
		      are chronic and do not respond to orthodox medicine. The process allows the expression and
		      resolution of these deep and subtle tensions so that the client’s inherent health is
		      reestablished.

		    <h3>About the Sessions</h3>
		    <p>
		      On your first session, there will be an opportunity to discuss your history and why you are
		      looking for treatment. Then you will lie clothed on a treatment couch and I will use a light
		      touch – listening through my hands to the tissues, muscles, bones, fluids, nervous system and
		      subtle energetic motions in your body. Most clients describe a deep relaxation, sometimes
		      experiencing some heat or tingling or other signs of a release of tension.
