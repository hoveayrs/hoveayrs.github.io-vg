			<p class="main">Storytelling by Vergine Gulbenkian</br>
				Vergine Gulbenkian was drawn to performance storytelling as a direct and essential form of communication in 1991, after studying drama.</br>
				Her interest led her to research the rich Armenian oral tradition; co-producing a documentary video about the ashugh (epic singer) tradition in Armenia.</br>
				The shows she creates are based on traditional tales, epics and myths, and she performs them in venues that have included the South Bank centre, the Battersea Arts Centre, and the British Museum.</br>
				She has received commissions from Storytelling festivals and was ‘Storyteller in Residence’ bringing traditional tales to schools.</br>
				She works with Museums, performs regularly at international storytelling festivals and shares the joy of telling and listening to stories in schools.</br>
